# EXAMPLE NO: 1
# pi = 3.14159
# print(pi)


# EXAMPLE NO: 2
# Both variables are int
# first_num = 5
# second_num = 3
# print(first_num + second_num)


# EXAMPLE NO: 3
# If we are taking input from user, the variable is a string
# num1 = input('Enter first number')
# num2 = input('Enter second number')
# print(num1 + num2)


# EXAMPLE NO: 4
# But now both strings are converted into integars. This is called type conversion
# num1 = input('Enter first number')
# num2 = input('Enter second number')
# print(int(num1) + int(num2))



# EXAMPLE NO: 5
# Here the variable is integar and Python be like : What the heck? How can i concatenate int with string? that's why i have converted int with str() to convert the integar into string
# days_in_feb = 28
# print('There are ' + str(days_in_feb) + ' days in February')
