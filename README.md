# Intro in python

## Here i will be sharing my coding journey with python

### 1. Hello.py : Just an introduction into python, how to print the mighty Hello World

### 2. turtle.py : By importing turtle, we can do some fun with it

### 3. check_tax.py : used if/else statement to show tax

### 4. comparing_strings.py : Strings are case sensitive so sometimes it can mess around

### 5. input_date,get_current_date,format_date,date_function : All of them are using datetime library from python where we can get current date and time and store them in a variable
