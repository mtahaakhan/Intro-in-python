    "Object Oriented Programming is one of the major paradigms in programming. The traditional programming paradigm is called procedural.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural works as follows:\n",
    "    The program has a state corresponding to the values of its variables.\n",
    "    Functions are called to act on these data.\n",
    "    Data are passed back and forth via function calls.\n",

    "Suppose there is a plane object, i need a stealth aircraft and my friend needs lca ( light combat aircraft ) and another friend needs a bomber aircraft. Everyone is building their own aircrafts but found that there are some similarities between them. Infact each object is just a different type of airplane. This is where inheritance saves time. Create one common class ( airplane ) and then define subclass (stealth,lca,bomber).\n",
    "3. Flexibility through polymorphism:\n",
    "Riffing on this example, you now need just a few pilots, or functions, like “flyplane,” flystealth” and “flybomber.” Stealth Fighter Pilots share some traits with LCA Pilots, but other things, like light combat missions and planes that are invisible to radar, are unique.\n",
